Scripts for:
1. Scoring whole peptides (kind of like mutation effect prediction, but we're putting in whole peptides instead of some mutations)
    - `kd_correlation_analysis.py` and `score_whole_peptide.py`
2. Sampling peptide sequences
    - Not done formally yet but it's simple, it's basically built-in ProteinMPNN functionality, just need to wrap it nicely with the experimental settings we want
